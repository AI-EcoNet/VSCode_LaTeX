# IEEE LaTeX Setup 2025

A **LaTeX environment setup for Windows** using **VS Code** as the main editor.  
This script automates the installation checks, fixes MiKTeX issues, downloads official IEEE templates, and compiles your first PDF ‚Äî all in one go.

---

## üìñ Backstory

I started this project after seeing my old masters project was hitting the limits of **Overleaf**.  
Compiling became painfully slow, and my master project was too large to recompile without paying for a premium plan.  

That was the perfect excuse for me to finally set up a **local LaTeX workflow**:  
- Faster compilation  
- Full control of dependencies  
- No internet dependency (unless you need to push updates with git)
- Works seamlessly with **VS Code**  

This script is the result: a **few step-setup** for IEEE papers on Windows.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Windows)

### Step 1 ‚Äì Install MiKTeX
Download and install from:  
üëâ [https://miktex.org/download](https://miktex.org/download)

### Step 2 ‚Äì Install Git
Download and install from:  
üëâ [https://git-scm.com/downloads/win](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)

### Step 3 ‚Äì Install Strawberry Perl
Download and install from:  
üëâ [https://strawberryperl.com/](https://strawberryperl.com/)

### Step 4 ‚Äì Install VS Code
Download and install from:  
üëâ [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Step 5 ‚Äì Install LaTeX Workshop Extension
In VS Code:  
- Open Extensions (Ctrl + Shift + X)  
- Search for **LaTeX Workshop**  
- Install it  

### Step 6 ‚Äì Run the Setup Script
- Right‚Äëclick `setup.ps1`  
- Select **‚ÄúRun with PowerShell‚Äù**  
- The script will:  
  - Check MiKTeX + Perl  
  - Fix MiKTeX script engines  
  - Let you choose an IEEE template  
  - Download and extract it into a project folder  
  - Compile the first PDF  
  - Open the project in VS Code

## üìÇ Template Options

When running the script, you can choose between:

1. **IEEE Conference Template**  
   For conference proceedings and workshop papers.  

2. **IEEE Journal/Transaction Template**  
   For journal articles and scientific papers.  

3. **IEEE Access Template**  
   For IEEE Access journal submissions.  

Each template is saved in its own folder inside the script directory:  
- `IEEE-Conference/`  
- `IEEE-Journal/`  
- `IEEE-Access/`
